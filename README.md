# Anzen Bootstrap
Anzen NAS System, changed the framework from Tailwind to Bootstrap cuz Tailwind is so fuckin complicated to deploy

Trial stage only. Still trying to work this shit out. Don't know how will this turn out.

Update: This thing works better than I thought. Gonna use the local offline one, so I don't need to connect
to the Internet

Current: Trying to connect to the MySQL database
